This project demontrate a arduino lock with a key pad and a ulta low energy weather station on the MSP430.
The battery capacity of AA batteries is 2500 mA/h and the daily average energy consumption of 7 mA/h, we get a weather station runtime of 356 days.

The documentation is only available in german, but the source code is documented in english.
